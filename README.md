Project Checklist
Part 1
Student created and worked within a new conda venv

Student loaded raw csv files “house_data.csv” and”house_sales.csv” into dataframes

Student created data dictionaries for both datasets which include variable names, descriptions, and datatypes

Student created copies of the raw dataframes to perform the data cleaning

Part 2
Student validated variable data types in both datasets

Student detected missing values in both datasets

Student detected outliers in both datasets

Student wrote data cleaning plan based on visual and programmatic assessment of dataframes

Part 3
Student set up data cleaning with a DEFINE // CLEAN // TEST approach

Student treated column name, casing, and spelling issues in both datasets

Student treated missing values in both datasets

Student treated outliers in both datasets

Student justified their approach for all data cleaning actions including how and why missing values and outliers were treated how they were

Part 4
Student re-expressed the following categorical columns as numeric: waterfront, view, and house_condition

Student wrote a justification and explanation of their approach on how they re-expressed each of the columns listed above

Part 5
Student successfully merged the cleaned dataframes into one master dataframe

Student saved master dataframe into a new master csv file
